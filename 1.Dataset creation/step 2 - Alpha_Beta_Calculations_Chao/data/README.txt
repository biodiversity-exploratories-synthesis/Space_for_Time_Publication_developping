Please deposit the datasets used in the scripts and produced by them in this folder. 

Order them as follows into the two data folders: 

2) InputData
Save intermediate dataset steps produced as output by scripts 1-3 in this folder. They will be used as input for the following scripts.  

3) OutputData
Save the final datasets ready for analysis produced by script 4 in this folder. They will be used as input folder for the 
statistical analysis (2.GDM, 3.LM). 



Note that there is an assembled dataset available which can be downloaded from BExIS (see general readme for details). If those are
used, they can be directly used as input to the data analysis (2. GDM, 3.LM).
