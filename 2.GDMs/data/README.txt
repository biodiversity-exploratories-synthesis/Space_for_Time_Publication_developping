Please deposit the datasets used in the scripts and produced by them in this folder. 

Order them as follows into the three data folders: 

1) RawData
Save the raw datasets downloaded from BExIS as input for intitial steps of data set creation (script 1 - prepare LUI covariates.R)  in this folder.
Consider the dataset description document to get the links to raw datasets used in this analysis. 

2) InputData
Save intermediate dataset steps produced as output by scripts 1-3 in this folder. They will be used as input for the following scripts.  

3) OutputData
Save the final datasets ready for analysis produced by script 4 in this folder. They will be used as input folder for the 
diversity calculations (dataset creation, step 2). 



Note that there is an assembled dataset available which can be downloaded from BExIS (see general readme for details). If those are
used, they can be directly used as input to the data analysis (2. GDM, 3.LM).
