# AIM
Scripts to fit and test the GDM models for temporal and spatial datasets, alpha and beta-diversity for plants, herbivores and predators.

# CONTENT

## Fitting GDM models
Note that the GDM scripts are twin scripts, with identical code.
- alpha diversity : space and year in one script : 
    - plants
    - herbivores
    - predators
- beta diversity : space and year in separate scripts : 
    - plants
        - space
        - time
    - herbivores
        - space
        - time
    - predators
        - space
        - time

## Permutation
Calculate p-values by permutation with varIMP. 
- space and time models : 
    - alpha diversity 
        - plants
        - herbivores
        - predators
    - beta diversity
        - plants
        - herbivores
        - predators

Testing the function
- GDM_varIMP_test_varimp.edit_function.R

Functions are loaded from the /R folder

Note that the Permutation part runs very slowly, and should be considered to be runned on a high-performance computer.
