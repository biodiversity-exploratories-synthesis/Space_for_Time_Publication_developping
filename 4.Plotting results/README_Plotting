# Plotting results

# Scripts to plot results for spatial and temporal 
# LUI responses of alpha and beta-diversity for plants, 
# arthropod herbivores and secondary consumers/predators. 

# The data paths need to be adapted to the directory situation. 
# If e.g. the recommendations of folder Structure in 
# 1.Dataset creation/step 1 - Prepare_input_data_plotwise_pairwise/data/README.txt were followed:
# the working directory should be set correspondingly to: 
# "1.Dataset creation/step 1 - Prepare_input_data_plotwise_pairwise/data/OutputData/"
